# ðŸš€ SUPER SIMPLE CLAUDE WORKFLOW

## What you do:
1. **Just work on your project**
2. **Tell Claude**: One of these:
   - "Check what has changed"
   - "What have I modified?"
   - "Check my changes"
   - "Git status"

## What I automatically do:
```python
1. git status           # Which files have changed
2. git diff            # What exactly has changed
3. git log             # Recent commits
4. Check the files     # Review specific changes
5. Give feedback       # Help with problems
```

## THAT'S IT! ðŸŽ‰

No CLAUDE_SYNC.md needed!
No extra documentation!
Just work and ask!

## ðŸŽ¯ Magic Phrases

### Start session:
> "Check what has changed"

### After lots of work:
> "Did a lot, check git diff"

### With problems:
> "Check [filename], there's a bug"

### For overview:
> "What did I do today?"

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip

### If you WANT to give context:
```
"Check what has changed. 
I was working on enemy spawning but 
it doesn't work properly."
```

### If you DON'T want to give context:
```
"Git status"
```

Both work perfectly!

*That's it! Just work and ask me to check!*
