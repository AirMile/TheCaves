## 📊 Progress Tracking

### **Weekly Review Questions**
**Evaluate every Sunday evening**:
1. Which milestones were achieved?
2. Which were delayed and why?  
3. What are the biggest blockers?
4. Should we adjust scope?
5. How do we feel about progress?

### **Risk Mitigation Strategy**
**If milestone is missed**:
1. **Minor delay** (1-2 days): Push other milestones slightly
2. **Major delay** (>3 days): Drop to backup plan
3. **Blocking issue**: Switch focus to other milestone  
4. **Scope too big**: Cut features immediately

### **Success Metrics**
**End of August Goals**:
- [ ] **Playable game**: Someone can play 10+ minutes
- [ ] **Core vision**: Neon cave art aesthetic works
- [ ] **Technical foundation**: Ready for post-August development
- [ ] **Team satisfaction**: Both people excited to continue

## 🎉 Celebration Milestones
- **Week 1 Complete**: First working build
- **Week 2 Complete**: First combat victory  
- **Week 3 Complete**: Multiple enemy types working
- **Week 4 Complete**: First external playtest

## 📋 Emergency Procedures
**If major blocker occurs**:
1. **Technical issue**: Document problem, ask online communities
2. **Art pipeline problems**: Switch to placeholder assets temporarily  
3. **Scope too ambitious**: Emergency scope reduction meeting
4. **Team conflict**: Clear roles/expectations re-discussion
5. **External problems**: Adjust timeline, maintain minimum viable goals

**Contact**: Always communicate blockers within 24 hours!
