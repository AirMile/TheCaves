## ‚è∞ Flexible Work Moments

**No fixed times!** Use templates when you work:
- Start work: Use `PROGRESS_CHECK_TEMPLATE`
- During work: Use `BLOCKER_TEMPLATE` if needed
- End work: Use `DAILY_UPDATE_TEMPLATE`
- Didn't work: Skip that day

## üìù Example Workflow

### You (speak in):
```
"Today I worked on player movement. 
The WASD movement works well now, but the controller 
input still has problems. I think it's the 
input mapping. Tomorrow I'll fix that and then 
start on the dash mechanic. Oh yeah, Git repository 
is created and first commit is pushed."
```

- ‚úÖ Daily update file created
- ‚úÖ TODO.md: "Player movement" ‚Üí completed

- ‚úÖ Known issue added to troubleshooting

2. Copy the template
3. Fill in with speech-to-text
4. Send to Claude
5. Claude updates everything!
