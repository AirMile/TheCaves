## 📝 Sprint Notes

### 2024-12-19 Standup
**Miles**: Working on shader system, need Jade's color palette for testing
**Jade**: Exploring neon aesthetics, will have palette ready by tomorrow

### Decisions Made
- Use feature branches for all development
- Shader system will support dynamic color changes
- Target 60 FPS with 100+ glowing enemies

### Risks & Issues
- ⚠️ Performance with many glow effects unknown
- ⚠️ Both new to feature branch workflow
